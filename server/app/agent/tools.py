"""Narrow-scoped tools.

Each tool does exactly one thing, declares a strict JSON Schema
(`additionalProperties: false`, every property required), and executes as
deterministic Python inside a graph node — never in the model layer. The
high-risk `draft_contact_message` tool never runs without a human approval;
nothing here can act on the outside world.

`search_knowledge` is semantic when a retriever is wired in (Postgres +
pgvector) and falls back to term overlap without one — or whenever the
vector search fails or comes back empty.
